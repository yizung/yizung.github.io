Love of my life, you've hurt me,  
You've broken my heart, and now you leave me.


Love of my life can't you see,  
Bring it back bring it back,  
Don't take it away from me,  
Because you don't know what it means to me.


Love of my life don't leave me,  
You've stolen my love and now desert me,


Love of my life can't you see,  
Bring it back bring it back,  
Don't take it away from me,  
Because you don't know what it means to me.


You will remember when this is blown over,  
And everythings all by the way,  
When I grow older,  
I will be there at your side,  
To remind you how I still love you  
I still love you.


Hurry back hurry back,  
Don't take it away from me,  
Because you don't know what it means to me.


Love of my life,  
Love of my life.
